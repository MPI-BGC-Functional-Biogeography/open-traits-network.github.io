## Best Practices to future-proof trait data in ecological and evolutionary sciences

### What is this?

Here is a community driven resource for best practices to future-proof trait data in ecological and evolutionary sciences.

The first idea come from the **"Ten (mostly) simple rules to future-proof trait data in ecological and evolutionary sciences"** in Methods in Ecology and Evolution  [doi:10.1111/2041-210X.14033](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14033). But this is a living document and is open for public additions from the scientific community.
