## Collaboration statement
I enjoy working on multiple projects exploring the human-wildlife interface, in disease ecology and conservation. I am part of several teams conducting large-scale data synthesis and modeling to explore disease vector traits, dynamics, and how those relate to our changing world. 

I am not an expert coder, by any means, but I can provide input on the processes of database set up, how to think about communicating best practices and workflows to the less familiar crowds; be this in the form of collaborative workshops, seminars, collaborative publications, blog posting, etc. I see myself as a facilitator and connector, with the experience of working across many collaborative projects.
