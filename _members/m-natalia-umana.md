Natalia is a forest ecologist based in Ann Arbor, Michigan USA. 

## Collaboration statement
I enjoy working on community and diversity questions using temporal data on demography and traits. 

I am happy to help connect people together around traits by hosting visitors in my lab, and organising symposia at conferences.
