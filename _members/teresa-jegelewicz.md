Teresa is a former accountant working with biodiversity data. 

## Collaboration statement
I work in a collaborative community developing a solution for managing museum collections data. I and my colleagues are always looking for ways to integrate our data with others to create "extended digital specimens".

I can assist with data normalization and clean up and also with introduction to a resource for storing both specimen based and observational trait data in a web-accessible tool. I would like to explore how the trait data held in our collective database could contribute to this project.
