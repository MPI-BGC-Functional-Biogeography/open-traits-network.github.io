Haiyang is a fungal ecologist based in Sydney Australia. 

## Collaboration statement
I am interested in applying fungal traits to understand their ecology, life strategy, and biogeography. I can offer expertise in workflows for microbial bioinformatics, text-mining,  cleaning occurrence data, and building the joint species distribution model.
