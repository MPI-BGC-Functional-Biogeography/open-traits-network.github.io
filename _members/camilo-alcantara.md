Camilo is a landscape ecologist based in Guanajuato, Mexico. 

## Collaboration statement
I am focused on the whereabouts of our house: The Earth. We know that whatever we do has an effect over our health, our life, our society and the other life forms that are surrounding us; but our knowledge still very shallow. I would really love to know more and contribute to the solution of the problems that we, humans, are cause of. To reach my personal goal I studied Biology, Statistics, and Geography and integrated my knowledge with Landscape Ecology and Land Transition Science. My hope is that at the end we can find the balance between human and natural systems in a sustainable manner.
