Pierre-Marie is a natural products chemist working at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland.

## Collaboration statement

I am interested in transforming untargeted metabolomics datasets to [Linked Open Data](https://handbook.opendata.swiss/de/content/glossar/bibliothek/linked-open-data.html). In the [COMMONS Lab](https://www.unifr.ch/bio/en/groups/allard/) we explore the potential of semantic web technologies and Open Science to better explore, organize and share information regarding the chemical constituents of living systems. We have recently launched the [Earth Metabolome Initiative](https://www.earthmetabolome.org/), which is an Open Science project aiming to characterize chemodiversity at the globale scale. For this we first build a pilot, the [Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative](https://www.dbgi.org/), where we focuss on the characterization of the chemistry of living botanical collections. 

- In a first move we do not plan to acquire traits but would rather like to integrate existing traits databases to Knowledge Graphs (KG) of metabolomics datasets. See the [ENPKG](https://enpkg.commons-lab.org/) for an example of such a KG.
- Later on, we would like to integrate traits measurement with the sample collection process.

We are looking forward to exchange with the Open Traits Network !
