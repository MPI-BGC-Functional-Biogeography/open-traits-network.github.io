Margot is a community and functional ecologist based in Frankfurt, Germany. 

## Collaboration statement
Plant ecologist by training, I am now working on ecological synthesis linking functional traits across multitrophic groups. I am happy to collaborate on developing pipelines and frameworks to better integrate functional trait data across taxa.
