## Collaboration statement

My lab studies whether and how metabolic constraints on individual organisms scale up to complex ecological systems (AKA ecosystems), using  trait-based mathematical and computational modeling.

I am one of the co-foundes of [BioTraits](https://ecologicaldata.org/wiki/global-biotraits-database) and its spin-off, the [VecTraits](https://legacy.vectorbyte.org/vectraits) (both currently being overhaled) databases. I offer expertise in workflows for constructing metabolic trait-focused databases. I am  currenly particularly interested in microbial metabolic traits (in an ecoligical context), and within that, thermal responses of these traits. 

I am keen on helping strenthen trait-based ecology in general. I am particularly keen on dicussing the possibilities of developing a global trait standard and database for "ecological metabolic traits" (starting with a dicussion of how to define this particular thing *per se*!), and am happy to support the Open Traits resource in any way that I can.
