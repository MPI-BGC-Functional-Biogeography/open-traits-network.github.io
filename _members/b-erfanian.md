Bagher is a plant ecologist based in Mashhad, Iran. 

## Collaboration statement
I enjoy working on applied Ecology. I am interested in disturbance ecology and evaluating how different human-mediated disturbances affect plant communities and change their features.
I could offer my expertise in the biodiversity (SD, PD, and FD) calculation and contribute trait data from my area.
