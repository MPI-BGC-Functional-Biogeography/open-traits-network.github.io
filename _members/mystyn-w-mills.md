I am a biogeographer/landscape ecologist interested in trait-based approaches to interaction diversity. I am especially interested in trait-based approaches to zoochorous seed dispersal interaction networks and the relations between functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and interaction diversity across spatial and temporal scales.

## Collaboration statement
I am working on the development of a project mapping and assessing functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and interaction diversity from local to global scales in Mediterranean climates. One goal of the project is to assess the potential of using decoupled functional and phylogenic dissimilarity and environment to predict interaction networks and diversity. 

I have experience working with species distribution models, individual-based models, and land change simulation models within applications such as syncro-sim, net-logo, and R. I work primarily in the mediterranean climate and have also conducted dietary analysis via scat sampling, assessed camera trap data, and analyzed acoustic data. I am using these various data sets coupled with extensive vegetation surveys to construct interaction networks.

I am interested in working with others conducting trait-based interaction research especially those also working in mediterranean climates. Additionally, I am interested in working with others looking into practical applications of such research with regard to restoration and rewilding. My lab currently includes master's students and advanced undergraduate students.
