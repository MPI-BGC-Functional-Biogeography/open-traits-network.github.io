JT is a recent bachelors graduate from UCSB interested in studying Bee & Angiosperm diversity & coevolutionary drivers. He is currently based in Gainesville Florida. 

## Collaboration statement
I am a researcher that enjoys using open source data to tackle questions in biodiversity science. My current research focuses on using spatial occurrences & interactions between bees and angiosperms to assess diversity drivers between the group on a spatial/temporal scale. I am interested in collaborating on methodology and providing feedback on datasets in open traits.
