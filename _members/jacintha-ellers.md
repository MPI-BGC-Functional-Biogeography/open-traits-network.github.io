Jacintha is a evolutionary ecologist based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 

## Collaboration statement
I am interested to understand the evolution of traits as a joint interplay of genes, genome, and environment. My primary contribution to trait ecology is the Handbook of protocols for standardized measurement of terrestrial invertebrate functional traits - published in Functional Ecology (Moretti et al 2017). 

I would be happy to collaborate on collecting physiological and life history trait data, and analyse these in a comparative and evolutionary framework. Most of my work is on arthropods (parasitoids, drosophila, Collembola) and other ectotherms (lizards, frogs), but keen to learn about new groups.
