Nuno Simoes is a marine biologist based in merida, yucatan, Mexico. 

## Collaboration statement
I am a broadly trained marine biologist and ecologist with a special interest in aquatic biodiversity and conservation, as well as sustainable aquaculture/fisheries. I am particularly interested on field studies in coral reefs, sandy beaches and other coastal habitats, including the fresh water sinkholes of the Yucatán peninsula, Mexico. Together with colleagues, I participate and co-lead three research groups. One related to biodiversity and conservation of the Yucatán peninsula sinkholes or cenotes (www.cenoteando.com), another related to marine biodiversity monitoring (www.bdmy.org.mx) and the third focused on marine ornamental species with a special interest on seahorse conservation (http://piecemo.sisal.unam.mx/).

I am very interested to learn more on how to contribute dynamic functional traits data on coastal, marine and freshwater species from our region of interest. I have very little experience and knowledge on programming and guess that my contribution will perhaps be more useful from the user prspective and raw data-gathering activities. I am also happy to help connect people together around traits by running working groups, hosting visitors in my lab, organising symposia at conferences and maintaining our Open Traits website.
