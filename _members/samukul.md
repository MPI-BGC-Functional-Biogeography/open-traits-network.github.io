## Collaboration statement
I am enthusiastic about applied ecology and conservation related issues. My primary research focus is tropical forest ecology and conservation. In my PhD project in the Philippines, I collected plant diversity and biomass data across a forest age gradient. I have tree demographic data (height, dbh, location), wood density data, successional guild, relevant soil parameters (NPK, SOC, pH, BD), fine root biomass, etc. A also maintain a dataset from Bangladesh, where I have both tree diversity and related data, bird/mammal/butterfly diversity and related info.

I can offer expertise in analysing trait data. I am also happy to contribute in any paper writing and maintaining this Open Traits website.
