Alexander Keller is working on ecological bioinformatics and species interctions. 

## Plant-Pollinator-Microbiome Triangle

Most of my research is dedicated to the interactions between plants and pollinators, and their respective interactions with microbes. My workgroup applies to a large part high-throughput sequencing techniques, i.e. metabarcoding and genomics, to address species interaction networks and functional diversity in these interactions. 

## Ecological Bioinformatics

We also work on a variety of computational pipelines to process large-scale data in ecological analyses, develop databases and provide webservices. Among these are mapping traits to ecological communities in bulk, as well as visualization of species interaction networks.
