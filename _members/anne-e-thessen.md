Anne is a semantic engineer with experience in microbial eukaryote taxonomy, plankton ecology, standards development, and data modeling.

## Collaboration statement
I enjoy making data easier to find, access, and reuse. A big part of this is developing data standards and linking data together. My background is in oceanography, biodiversity informatics, and geoinformatics. I have experience with bringing communities together to develop standards and best practices. My motivation behind this is being able to perform meta-analyses and answer large-scale questions.

I can offer expertise in data modeling and data integration, particularly for trait data using ontologies and other standards.
