Francisco is a computational ecologist and biogeographer based in Sevilla, southern Spain. 

## Collaboration statement

I enjoy compiling data using reproducible workflows to tackle ecological and biogeographical questions. We are currently developing a comprehensive database of fruit and seed traits which we hope will help everyone answer interesting questions regarding fruit and seed ecology and biogeography as well as plant dispersal modes.
