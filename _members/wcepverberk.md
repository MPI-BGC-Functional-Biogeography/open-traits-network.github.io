Wilco is a ecophysiologist working on aquatic ectotherms based in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

## Collaboration statement
I enjoy analysing on physiological traits (metabolic rate, thermal tolerance) and life-history traits (growth, development, body size). My work focuses on aquatic insects and other (aquatic) ectotherms. I support initiatives for the synthesis of trait informations and hope to do more work on this in the near future.
