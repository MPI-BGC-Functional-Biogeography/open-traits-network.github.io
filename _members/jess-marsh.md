Jess is an invertebrate ecologist and taxonomist based in South Australia

## Collaboration statement
My work is focused around invertebrates and I am interested in the use of traits, ecological, and spatial data to investigate some of the (many) questions and challenges facing invertebrate conservation in Australia and internationally. I am particularly interested in inter-taxa interactions and dependencies, and the influence that this has on species conservation. I am also a taxonomist, working on spiders.

I lead the AusInverTraits project - using the AusTraits framework and workflows to create an integrated traits database for invertebrate species in Australia.

I am keen to collaborate and can provide invertebrate taxonomic and ecological expertise.
