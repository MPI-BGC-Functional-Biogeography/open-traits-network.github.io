Katie is a project and data manager for the Symbiota Support Hub at Arizona State University. She manages several biodiversity data portals based on scientific specimens (e.g., herbaria, entomological collections, vertebrate collections).

## Collaboration statement

I work with natural history / biodiversity specimen collections, many of which are interested in capturing, storing, and sharing trait data from their specimens. I largely think about this problem in the realm of the content management system and data aggregator software [Symbiota](https://www.symbiota.org/), which largely shares data according to the Darwin Core standard. I'm interested in learning more about how traits data are shared outside the biodiversity specimen network and how these data can be increasingly mobilized by my community.
