Jennifer is an entomologist based in Texas, United States. 

## Collaboration statement
I'm one of the curators of the [Ontology for the Anatomy of the Insect SkeletoMuscular system (AISM)](https://github.com/insect-morphology/aism) and the [Coleoptera Anatomy Ontology (COLAO)](https://github.com/insect-morphology/colao), which aim to standardize terms and definitions referring to the anatomy of insects in general and of beetles, respectively.

I look forward to find ways to integrate these ontologies into the world of trait data. We already have ideas of the potential of these ontologies for evolutionary research (outlined in this [preprint](https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202201.0254.v1)), but it would be interesting to see the system working with measured traits.
