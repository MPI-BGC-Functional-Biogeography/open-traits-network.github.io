David is an ecologist based in the United Kingdom. 

## Collaboration statement
My research focusses on monitoring and assessment of biodiversity, particularly via citizen science approaches. I lead international schemes measuring how butterfly numbers respond to habitat loss and climate change.  I have developed trait datasets and have used them to understand biodiversity change.

I can offer my expertise, and that of my research group, in workflows for analysis occurrence data and combining with trait data. I can also supply trait data for the UK.
