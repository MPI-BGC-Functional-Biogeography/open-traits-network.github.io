## Collaboration statement

My current research interests include (but are not limited to) species interaction networks, the role of species traits and scale in said networks, and general computer (and maths) geekiness. Although a past trait data collector I'm probably more of a trait data re-user at this point...

I'm most likely happy to hop onboard most things. A newbie `Julia` user but happy to talk about working on a potential compliment to {ROpenTraits} in the long term. Or anything related to the data re-use/synthesis pipeline really...
