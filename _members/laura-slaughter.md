## Collaboration statement
I have been working on a TraitBank with the Norwegian Biodiversity Data Centre. I am also involved in the EU projects [DTO-Bioflow](https://dto-bioflow.eu) and [AquaINFRA.](https://aquainfra.eu) 
I am interested in knowledge graphs, ontologies, and have a background in knowledge representation.
