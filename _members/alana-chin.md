Alana is a plant ecologist based in Switzerland

## Collaboration statement
I measure anatomical, morphological, and physiological traits of trees, my work is focused validation of trait function and water/cold stress tolerance. I like anatomy, fieldwork, and a good experiment.

I can offer help with anatomical technique and workflows.
