Katja is an insect biologist working in Santa Barbara California.

## Collaboration statement
I enjoy working on bees and other insects and publishing research about insect biodiversity, biodiversity data science, and insect responses to environmental changes or conditions. I presently am coordinating a project called [Big Bee](http://big-bee.net) that examines bee traits from images. I can offer expertise in insect biology and natural history collection data and hope to connect people to the Big-Bee project via idea sharing, conversation, and research collaborations.
