Brunno is interested in understanding what shapes biodiversity distribution across multiple dimensions (traits, genes, taxa), and predict how biodiversity can eroded/reshuffle from climate change.

## Collaboration statement
As a Open Data advocate, I am interested in gathering and contributing with trait data to the community. I have worked on AmphiBIO, a global database on amphibian traits (https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017123). I can offer expertise in merging trait data across multiple databases, calculating biodiversity metrics, cleaning occurrence data, and taxonomy harmonization. I am also happy to help organising symposia at conferences
