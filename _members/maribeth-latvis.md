## Collaboration statement
I apply evolutionary history (phylogenies) to understand patterns of species relationships, community assembly, and trait evolution. As Director of the CA Taylor Herbarium (SDC), I am interested in creating an Extended Specimen Network for our prairie species that links specimens to related metadata (locality, data, genetic, trait). Many species used in plant restoration have very little available trait data, and I would be interested in filling this gap.
