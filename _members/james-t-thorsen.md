Jim is a statistical ecologist based in Seattle, WA, USA.

## Collaboration statement
I conduct ecologically motivated and statistically innovative research that has direct bearing upon natural resource management.  Research themes include:
* Meta-analysis testing predictions from ecological theory
* Spatio-temporal models, particularly for community ecology
* Estimation of biological processes that vary over space and time
* Global fisheries status and productivity
* Development and testing of ecological models and methods

My primary open trait dataset is FishLife - a research and operational product that compiles population-dynamics, morphometric, behavioral, reproductive, trophic, and other traits for all described fishes, combined with a phylogenetic trait imputation tool that estimates values (with associated uncertainty) for traits that have not been measured.

I can offer expertise in fish life-history theory, methods for phylogenetic comparative methods involving large trees and trait databases, and connecting traits with habitat utilization.
