Hazel is a plant ecology student researcher based in East Lansing, Michigan. 

## Collaboration statement
I am currently working on a project to align plant and frugivore traits in space: improving biodiversity conservation assessments for Neotropical plants. I am using the BIEN and TRY databases for plants in this research.

I am interested in learning from more experienced researchers in the field and ensuring my work is following the characteristics of open science.
