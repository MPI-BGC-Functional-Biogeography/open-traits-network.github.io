Fernando is a plant ecologist based in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. 

## Collaboration statement
My primary research interests are on the ecology and evolution of seed traits, and how we can improve seed-based techniques to manage and restore tropical grassy biomes. 

My collaborators, students and I have been working on theoretical and empirical studies that can advance our understanding of the regeneration niche by creating and analyzing databases on plant reproductive traits (flowers, fruits and seeds).
