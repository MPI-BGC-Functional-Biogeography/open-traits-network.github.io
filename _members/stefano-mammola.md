Stefano is an ecologist based in Verbania, Italy. He is fascinated by cave ecosystems and spiders. 

## Collaboration statement
I enjoy working with an assortment of ecological questions using functional ecology tools. My primary open trait dataset is CAWEB - a curated dataset on the traits of subterranean spiders in Europe (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01316-3) (hopefully to be extended globally one day). I'm also an editor of the World Spider Trait database (https://spidertraits.sci.muni.cz/).

I can offer expertise in functional diversity analyses. I am also happy to help connect people working with traits by running joint analyses, working groups, and hosting visitors in my lab.
