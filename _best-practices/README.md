## Best Practices to future-proof trait data in ecological and evolutionary sciences

### What is this?

Here is a community driven resource for best practices to future-proof trait data in ecological and evolutionary sciences.

The first idea come from the **"Ten (mostly) simple rules to future-proof trait data in ecological and evolutionary sciences"** in Methods in Ecology and Evolution  [doi:10.1111/2041-210X.14033](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14033). But this is a living document and is open for public additions from the scientific community. 

### I have some comments

You can add your comments by using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/open-traits-network/open-traits-network.github.io/issues)

### I want to create new docs/add new references

Please do! 
1. Anyone can fork the repos, change/add contents and make pull requests, or [create an issue in the tracker](https://github.com/open-traits-network/open-traits-network.github.io/issues)in the folder ```_best-practices```.
2. Please keep to the nomenclature of files, as seen in the folder ```_best-practices```. There is some order to this considering the Trait Life Cycle, so if creating new documents, order them by numbers where they fit best e.g. ```03.1_my-new-best-practice.md```
3. Add new references if applicable to ```_best-practices/99_references.md```
4. An Editor will have a look at your changes, and either merge immediately or get back to you. For faster responses, consider tagging @chiras or @cpenone.

### I want to add an abstract in my language

You are encourage to add more languages of abstracts in Github, in the folder ```_best-practices/simple_abstracts/your-language.md```

### I have some questions
